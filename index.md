After completing my PhD studying the molecular mechanisms of actin, myosin, and formin to facilitate transport, organelle inheritance, and vesicle trafficking in the globally distributed intracellular eukaryotic parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>, I now focus on how <i>T. gondii</i> manipulates host cell machinery to support its survival and replication.

My current research investigates how <i>T. gondii</i> hijacks the host Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) to ingest macromolecules. To explore these processes, I use imaging techniques—such as expansion microscopy and live-cell imaging alongside high-throughput screening to identify novel regulators of in multiple stages of the <i>T. gondii</i> life cycle. 

I am also interested in discovering and developing therapeutics that target <i>T. gondii</i>, with the broader goal of revealing vulnerabilities of <i>T. gondii</i> that can be leveraged for drug development to hopefully treat individuals suffering from Toxoplasmosis.


## Current Interests and Projects

- High-content imaging and automated analysis pipelines  
- Expansion microscopy for nanoscale resolution  
- Live-cell imaging of host–parasite interactions  
- Identifying parasite-derived regulators of host ESCRT machinery  
- Antiparasitic drug discovery and therapeutic development
