After completing my PhD studying the molecular mechanisms of actomyosin-based transport, organelle inheritance, and vesicle trafficking in the intracellular eukaryotic parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>, I now focus on how <i>T. gondii</i> manipulates host cell machinery to support its survival and replication.

My current research investigates how the parasite hijacks the host Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) to ingest macromolecules. To explore these processes, I use advanced imaging techniques—such as expansion microscopy and live-cell imaging alongside high-throughput screening to identify novel regulators. 

Beyond fundamental cell biology, I am also interested in discovering and developing therapeutics that target <i>T. gondii</i>, with the broader goal of revealing parasite vulnerabilities that can be leveraged for drug development.


## Current Interests and Projects

- High-content imaging and automated analysis pipelines  
- Expansion microscopy for nanoscale resolution  
- Live-cell imaging of host–parasite interactions  
- Identifying parasite-derived regulators of host ESCRT machinery  
- Antiparasitic drug discovery and therapeutic development
